\section{Introduction}
Classical physics treats mass as a fundamental property of matter, often defined in terms of inertia and energy storage. However, under the Unified Theory of Energy (UTE), mass is not a fixed entity but a manifestation of the balance between Radiation and Gravitation. This paper redefines mass as an emergent property of recursive energy exchanges, where particles serve as intermediaries within the surface interactions of mass structures.

\section{Redefining Mass as a Process}
The classical equation for mass-energy equivalence,
\begin{equation}
    E = mc^2,
\end{equation}
assumes mass is an intrinsic property that stores energy. However, if mass is instead a localized equilibrium between Radiation and Gravitation, then energy should be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    E = G \cdot R,
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $G$ represents \textbf{Gravitation} (stored energy, potential energy),
    \item $R$ represents \textbf{Radiation} (extended energy, kinetic energy, electromagnetic waves).
\end{itemize}

Thus, mass is not a fundamental quantity but rather the result of a stable exchange between these two energy states.

\section{Implications of the Reformulation}
\subsection{Mass as a Dynamic Process}
Instead of being a property of objects, mass emerges from the balance of Gravitation and Radiation. A stable mass structure is simply a system in equilibrium where:
\begin{equation}
    G_{stored} \approx R_{extended}.
\end{equation}
If Radiation outpaces Gravitation, the structure sheds mass. If Gravitation dominates, mass accumulates and can eventually collapse.

\subsection{Particles as Transitional Energy States}
Particles are not fundamental building blocks but localized states of energy exchange within a system. They exist in the surface region where:
\begin{equation}
    G \leftrightarrow R.
\end{equation}
This redefines atomic and subatomic interactions as recursive surface interactions rather than discrete particle exchanges.

\subsection{Inertia as Resistance to Radiation Expansion}
Classical physics defines inertia as resistance to acceleration due to mass. However, in the recursive model:
\begin{equation}
    I = G \cdot M,
\end{equation}
where inertia ($I$) is simply the degree to which stored Gravitation resists external Radiation influences.

\subsection{Black Holes at the Center of Mass Structures}

A *Singularity* is a Synthetic Construct invented by mathematicians to facilitate the denial of energy recursion. It is proposed as a new type of celestial body where Gravitation exceeds Radiation so greatly that it enters a new state where Radiation cannot extend: 

\begin{equation}
    G_{\text{stored}} \gg R_{\text{extended}}.
\end{equation}

Unfortunately for the poor and lonely Black Hole, this violates the **Energy State Theorem**:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Theorem 1} \textit{Energy exists in three distinct states: as Radiation, as Gravitation, and as Particulate Motion. Each of these three energy states cannot exist apart from, or without, the other states.}
\end{quote}

There cannot be a scenario where Gravitation and Particulate Motion exist without Radiation extending, thereby resisting a collapse. The failure to recognize true energy dimensionality has led to this Synthetic Construct.

This is not to deny the *Black Hole* itself, if considered at the correct Scale or Topological Dimension. In fact, this demon is guarding the very entrance or exit to energy recursion, deterring those who fear such constructs. The fallacy arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of how energy transitions recursively across dimensions, vibrating Particles that resist change.

Thus, let us reconsider Black Holes—not as giant, insatiable dark moons consuming the galaxy, but rather as the theoretical zero-radius core at the center of every Radiation Source. At this point, where the radius to the Surface is zero, Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation breaks down, despite the continued denial of recursion.

\section{Conclusion}
Mass is not a standalone quantity but a result of the dynamic equilibrium between Radiation and Gravitation. Particles, inertia, and energy exchanges are surface interactions occurring within a recursive framework. This model dissolves the artificial separation between mass and energy, providing a unified perspective applicable across scales from atomic structures to cosmic bodies.
